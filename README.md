# Blog API 
I have been interested in building a front-end agnostic blogging 
platform. Which lead me to the API as the logical choice! 
I also want the API to be extendable via plugins.

Should you want to fork or contribute to this project please feel free.  

To get started:
  Make sure you have npm, node and typescript installed on your machine.
  From your terminal run 
  ```
  npm install or yarn install
  ```
To run the test suite:
```
npm run test
```
To run the development server:
```
// watches for changes in typescript files located in the src dir
npm run watch-ts & npm run watch-node
```

To build the api:

Compiles the typescript files to dist folder and runs tslint
```
npm run build
```
