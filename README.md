# CMS / Blog API
Experimental CMS framework that is front-end agnostic and extendable via plugins. 
This is in the very early stages and as such is NOT useable yet. Questions / Ideas 
or contributions are welcome.


To get started:
  Make sure you have [node / npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) installed on your machine.

  From your terminal run 
  ```
  npm install or yarn install
  ```
To run the test suite:
```
npm run test
```
To run the development server:
```
// changes are auto compiled and server is restarted
nodemon
```

To build the api:

Compiles the typescript files to dist folder and runs tslint
```
npm run build
```
